# Javascript-Password-Generator
An application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by Javascript code.

When the "Generate Password" button is clicked, the user is presented with a series of prompts asking for their preferences on password length, and character types to be included. The user can choose any combination of lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters, with a length between 8-128. After selections have been made, a randomly generated password made up of their character selections and specific length is presented in the password text area. Once the password is generated in the text area, the user can then click the "Copy to Clipboard" button which will copy the randomly generated code to their clipboard.
